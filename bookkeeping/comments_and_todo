************GENERAL "FIXME/FIND-OUT" COMMENTARY************

-is it possible to define constants within a package which would be visible to all nodes in the package
and which could be imported by nodes in other packages? (example: names of messages, calibration constants)

-PID loops on PRU (BBB):
    1. motor drivers for drive wheels
    2. actuator for dig wheel (control w/ pwm to relays)

-soft_stop error handler: for actuator, attempt to go in the correcion direction, or just stop?
